This was just off FM530 on Road 16C, near the community of Light Chapel.  This tornado touched down just south of a mobile home and began moving toward the northeast.  A father, along with two sons and a daughter, had just arrived home less than an hour before the touchdown and had fallen asleep when the storm struck.  The father reported feeling a jolt that awakened him as severe thunderstorm winds ahead of the tornado struck the mobile home.  He reported that it became quiet again and then the mobile home exploded as the tornado stuck.  He and his three children were blown and tossed almost 150 feet, coming to rest on the top of the former south wall of his mobile home.  Broken glass was everywhere, but, in spite of cuts and bruises, they took shelter in a small nearby roofless shack as hail continued to fall.  He then walked, carrying an injured son and daughter, to a neighbor???s house to call for help.  His truck, parked under an awning just south of the mobile home was rolled and crushed.  Had he and his children arrived only a few minutes later at their home, they could easily have been killed.

Based on the destroyed mobile home, which had been tied down, and the rolled and twisted metal frame, the tornado was rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Winds were estimated at 115 mph.

The hail that did fall was in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.  One inch diameter hail covered the ground in Davis County at Bloomfield.
