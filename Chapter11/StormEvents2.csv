Wind sensors above timberline measured peak gusts from 75 to 92 mph.  The combination of snow and wind resulted in whiteout conditions and a high avalanche danger along the Interstate 70 Corridor, from Floyd Hill to Vail.  As a result, the interstate was closed for approximately 24 hours.  Other closures included:  Berthoud and Rabbit Ears Passes on U.S. Highway 40; Loveland Pass on U.S. Highway 6; Cameron Pass on State Highway 14; Kenosha Pass on U.S. Highway 285; U.S. Highways 287 and 85 near the Wyoming Border.   ||The American Red Cross opened 9 shelters in Summit County for stranded motorists; where more than 2,000 people took shelter.  Loveland Ski Area was forced to close for the day because employees and skiers couldn't get to it.  Tow truck drivers spent much of their time rescuing stranded motorists.  In Grand County, a snowmobiler was injured when he triggered an avalanche.  He was knocked unconscious and buried under 3 feet of snow.  Fortunately, he suffered only a separated shoulder.  ||Peak wind gust reports included:  92 mph at Niwot Ridge; 89 mph at Mines peak; 87 mph at Georgetown; 80 mph at Berthoud and Loveland Passes; 75 mph at Gunsight; 60 mph at Copper Mountain.  Storm totals during the 2-day period were light to moderate with amounts ranging from 5 to 10 inches.
